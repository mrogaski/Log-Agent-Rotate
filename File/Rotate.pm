=head1 NAME

Log::Agent::File::Rotate - a rotating logfile set

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 #
 # This class is not user-visible.
 #
 # It is documented only for programmers wishing to inherit
 # from it to further extend its behaviour.
 #

 require Log::Agent::Driver::File;
 require Log::Agent::Rotate;
 require Log::Agent::File::Rotate;

 my $config = Log::Agent::Rotate->make(...);
 my $driver = Log::Agent::Driver::File->make(...);
 my $fh = Log::Agent::File::Rotate->make("file", $config, $driver);

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This class represents a rotating logfile and is used drivers wishing
to rotate their logfiles periodically.  From the outside, it exports
a single C<print> routine, just like C<Log::Agent::File::Native>.

Internally, it uses the parameters given by a C<Log::Agent::Rotate> object
to transparently close the current logfile and cycle the older logs.

Before rotating the current logfile, the string:

    *** LOGFILE ROTATED ON <local date>

is emitted, so that people monitoring the file via "tail -f" know about
it and are not surprised by the sudden stop of messages.

Its exported interface is:

=over 4

=item make I<file>, I<config>

This is the creation routine.  The I<config> object is an instance of
C<Log::Agent::Rotate>.

=item print I<args>

Prints I<args> to the file.  After having printed the data, monitor the file
against the thresholds defined in the configuration, and possibly rotate
the logfiles according to the parameters held in the same configuration
object.

When the C<is_alone> flag is not set in the configuration, the logfile is
checked everytime a C<print> is issued to see if its inode changed.  Indeed,
when several instances of the same program using rotating logfiles are
running, each of them may decide to cycle the logs at some point in time, and
therefore our opened handle could point to an already renamed or unlinked file.
